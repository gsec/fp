\section{Basics}
%Warum AFM\\
The relevance of fabrication and therefore also the analysis of structure in the 
sub-micrometer and even nanometer scale has increased steadily in the past 
decades. In contrast to other scanning imaging techniques as the STM or SEM, the 
atomic force microscope (AFM) is capable to deliver up to atomic resolution 
without the need of a vacuum or special treatment of the probe prior to 
analysis. This allows us to examine a broader variety of samples under easily 
achievable conditions.

\subsection{Work principle of the AFM}
%Funktionsweise AFM\\
The principle of the atomic force microscope are the forces that act between two 
pieces of matter when brought close to each other. More precisely we bring a 
sharp tip into a distance of a few nano meters to  a surface we want to examine.  
scale the main contribution are Van-der-Waals forces which arise from 
polarisation fluctuations in the material.
In \figref{afm_scheme} one can see the main parts required to run the AFM. 
The sample is mounted on a xyz-stage consisting of different piezo elements. 
This enables us to move the sample in xy-direction for the scanning of the 
probe, as well as in the z direction for height compensation. A reflecting 
cantilever is positioned above the sample. A laser beam will reflect on the 
cantilever and hits a segmented photodiode. If the cantilever moves, the 
laser beam will change the angle of deflection, detectable by the photodiode.
From the intensity change on the diode segments one can calculate the height 
difference of the material.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    %\includegraphics{Bilder/afm_scheme.svg}
    \caption{Simplified illustration of an atomic force microscope}
    \label{fig:afm_scheme}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Refinements}
Instead of mapping the intensity change on the diode to the force and 
subsequently to the probe height, often a different approach is used. The tip is 
set to apply a constant force on the probe. If the force changes, the piezo in 
z-direction is altered to move the probe to a height where the force is equal to 
the set point defined before. This has the advantage that the force between tip 
and probe is approximately constant and therefore it is less likely to damage 
the sample or the tip. This is ensured via a feedback loop between the the diode 
and the piezo element as seen in \figref{control_loop}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    %\includegraphics{Bilder/control_loop.pdf}
    \caption{Principle of a feedback loop with disturbance $z(t)$, output 
        $r(t)$, control signal $u(t)$, measured output $x(t)$ and error signal 
        $e(t)$.}
    \label{fig:control_loop}
\end{figure}

The height information accquired via this method is more strongly connected to 
the actual sample surface. The mapping is done between the piezo voltage as 
opposed to the strength of the diode, the angle of the lase beam and the 
distances between those elements. Therefore introducing less error sources and 
leading to a more accurate signal.

\section{Data Aquisition}
\label{dataaquisition}
In order to acquire the topology of the samples surface the computer records the scanner's $z$-position in combination with the in plane $x$- and $y$-position. These data can be exported from the control software in a special (.ezd) data format. We convert these data back into a list of $x$, $y$ and $z$-coordinates using the \textit{WSxM} software, which is freely available on ??. 

While scanning in static force mode is necessary to maintain the force by moving the scanner's $z$-position. This is done by a feedback loop, which compares the a stated force constant to the force calculated from the signal of the photodiode. The difference is called the error signal and is the basis for the PI-controller. This controller includes to variables, the P- and I-values, which can be adjusted at the control software.
While recording the data we can adjust the P- and I-values to optimize the quality of the pictures and avoid image artifacts. These values refer to the proportional and integral gain of the z-controllers feedback loop respectively. The proportional gain provides a signal which is proportional to the error signal. By increasing this value one should observe a smaller static error signal and a faster adaption to the current height position.
On the other hand, if this value is set to high, one should observe a overshoots while scanning steps. Even higher P-values lead to more noise as the scanner is reacting oversensitive to little changes in height. The I-value however provides a signal which is proportional to the temporal integral of the error signal. The adaption of this value may have similar effects as adaption the P-value. Nevertheless the signal from the integral controller is lee sensitive to noise.

In the beginning of the experiment we scanned a calibration grid while varying the P- and I-parameter to see the effects on the pictures quality. The calibration grid consists of a grid with two different height levels. By scanning the grid in one direction one should observe steps in the up and down direction. In the following pictures every scan is conducted from the left the right side. Firstly we started with a low I-value and observed the $z$-coordinate adepting very slowly to the actual height of the grid as is shown in \ref{wenigI}.

\begin{figure}[htp]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{Bilder/wenigI}
		\caption{Height profile recorded with the I-gain value set to 5. $\mathrm{P}=9$. Scanning direction is from left to right.}
		\label{wenigI}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

By increasing the I-value the height is adapting much more quickly but overshoots at the step's edge as well as increasing the amount of noise during the plateaus. The height profile is plotted in \ref{vielI}.

\begin{figure}[htp]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{Bilder/vielI}
		\caption{Height profile recordes with the I-gain value set to 11. $\mathrm{P}=9$. Scanning direction is from left to right.}
		\label{vielI}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

In the next step the influence of the P-value was observed. With the I-value set to $9$ the p-value was varied from $5$ to $15$. Interestingly an decrease of the P-value to $5$ doesn't change much but increasing the overshoots caused by the I-value, which is set little higher than the optimum value. Simultaneously the overshoots decrease when increasing the P-value. This however has a negative influence on the noise as can be seen in the comparison of \ref{wenigP} and \ref{vielP}.

\begin{figure}[htp]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{Bilder/wenigP}
		\caption{Height profile recordes with the P-gain value set to 5. $\mathrm{I}=9$. Scanning direction is from left to right.}
		\label{wenigP}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htp]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{Bilder/vielP}
		\caption{Height profile recordes with the P-gain value set to 15. $\mathrm{I}=9$. Scanning direction is from left to right.}
		\label{vielP}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

As a trade-off between fast and accurate height adaption and a minimum of noise we choose $\mathrm{I}=9$ and $\mathrm{I}=7$. We use these parameters in all following measurements, if not stated differently.

Next we want to investigate what influence the speed of scanning has on the image recording. We measure the calibration grid with $\SI{0.7}{\second}$ and $\SI{3}{\second}$ per line. During this period 256 data points are recorded along the scanning axis. 
For the slow scan speed we observe in \ref{slow} the clear step of the calibration grit without any noticeable overshoot. For the faster scanning speed we can see in \ref{fast} distinct overshoots at the beginning of each step.

\begin{figure}[htp]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{Bilder/slow}
		\caption{Height profile recordes with a scanning sped of $\SI{3}{\second}$ per line. $\mathrm{P}=9$, $\mathrm{I}=9$, scanning direction is from left to right.}
		\label{slow}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htp]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{Bilder/fast}
		\caption{Height profile recordes with a scanning sped of $\SI{0.7}{\second}$ per line. $\mathrm{P}=9$, $\mathrm{I}=9$, scanning direction is from left to right.}
		\label{fast}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Although we observe artifacts while scanning the calibration grit with  $\SI{0.7}{\second}$ per line it is possible to measure structures without steep gradient with a higher scanning speed without observing overshoots.
