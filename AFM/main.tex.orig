\section{Motivation}
\input{expose}
\newpage

\section{Basics}
The relevance of fabrication and therefore also the analysis of structure in the 
sub-micrometer and even nanometer scale has increased steadily in the past 
decades. In contrast to other scanning imaging techniques as the STM or SEM, the 
atomic force microscope (AFM) is capable to deliver up to atomic resolution 
without the need of a vacuum or special treatment of the probe prior to 
analysis. This allows us to examine a broader variety of samples under easily 
achievable conditions.

\subsection{Principle of the AFM}
The principle of the atomic force microscope are the forces that act between two 
pieces of matter when brought close to each other. More precisely we bring a 
<<<<<<< HEAD
sharp tip into a distance of a few nano meters to a surface of interest. At this 
scale the main contribution are Van-der-Waals forces which arise from 
polarisation fluctuations in the material. In \cref{afm_scheme} one can see the 
main parts required to run the AFM.  The sample is mounted on a xyz-stage 
consisting of different piezo elements.  This enables us to move the sample in 
xy-direction for the scanning of the probe, as well as in the z direction for 
height compensation. A reflecting cantilever is positioned above the sample. A 
laser beam reflects on the cantilever and hits a segmented photodiode. If the 
cantilever moves, the laser beam will change the angle of deflection.  From the 
intensity change on the diode segments the height difference of the material is 
derrived.

The main contribution are Van-der-Waals forces which arise from

Fermi's exclusion principle.

This enables us to move the sample in xy-direction for the scanning of the 
probe, as well as in the z direction for height compensation. A reflecting 
cantilever is positioned above the sample. A laser beam will reflect on the 
cantilever and hits a segmented photodiode. If the cantilever moves, the 
laser beam will change the angle of deflection, detectable by the photodiode.
From the intensity change on the diode segments one can calculate the height 
difference of the material.

    \includegraphics{Bilder/afm_scheme.pdf}
    \caption{Simplified illustration of an atomic force microscope}
    \label{afm_scheme}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Technical refinements}
Instead of mapping the intensity change on the diode to the force and 
subsequently to the probe height, often a different approach is used. The tip is 
set to apply a constant force on the probe. If the force changes, the piezo in 
z-direction is altered to move the probe to a height where the force is equal to 
the set point defined before. This has the advantage that the force between tip 
and probe is approximately constant and therefore it is less likely to damage 
the sample or the tip. This is ensured via a feedback loop between the the diode 
and the piezo element as seen in \cref{control_loop}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{Bilder/control_loop.pdf}
    \caption{Principle of a feedback loop with characteristic variables: 
    disturbance $z(t)$, set point $r(t)$, control signal $u(t)$, measured output 
    $x(t)$ and error signal $e(t)$.}
    \label{control_loop}
\end{figure}

The height information accquired via this method is more strongly connected to 
the actual sample surface. The mapping is done between the piezo voltage as 
opposed to the strength of the diode, the angle of the laser beam and the 
distances between those elements. Therefore introducing less error sources and 
leading to a more accurate signal.

\section{The AFM Experiment}
\label{Experiment}
\subsection{Samples}
In \cref{motivation} we described different samples of interest. Since we 
encountered problems during the sample growth, measurements were only performed 
on four of the samples. The samples are listed with a short description in 
\cref{samples}.
=======
The resolution of the used AFM is within the range of several nanometers. Adequately
to measure the surface of the GaSb-wafers. These samples are normally characterized 
by optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. As these 
techniques offer very less information about the sample's surface structure the AFM 
provides us a new possibility to gain this information.

\section{The AFM Experiment}
\label{Experiment}
\subsection{Samples}
In the expose we described different samples which would be  interesting for us. Nevertheless 
due to failure during the growth of the samples we could only execute the measurements of four samples.
The samples with a short discretion of their properties are listed in \cref{samplesprep}

\subsection{Parameters of recording}
In order to acquire the topology of the samples surface the computer records the 
scanner's $z$-position in combination with the in plane $x$- and $y$-position. 
These data can be exported from the control software in a special (.ezd) data 
format. We convert these data back into a list of $x$, $y$ and $z$-coordinates 
using the \textit{WSxM} software, which is freely available on \cite{nanotec}. 

While scanning in static force mode it is necessary to maintain the force 
constant by moving the scanner's $z$-position. This is done via a feedback loop, 
which compares the set force to the force calculated from the signal of the 
photodiode. The difference is called the error signal and is the input for the 
PI-controller. In the AFM control software the \textbf{P}(roportional) and 
\textbf{I}(ntegral) parts are adjustable.  While recording the data we can 
adjust the \textbf{P} and \textbf{I} values to optimize the respose of the 
feedback loop thus reducing image artifacts.  These values refer to the 
proportional and integral gain of the z-controllers feedback loop respectively. 
% The proportional gain provides a signal which is proportional to the error 
% signal. 
By increasing the \textbf{P} value one should observe a smaller static error and 
a faster adaption to the current height position. On the other hand, if this 
value is set to high, overshoots while scanning steps are likely. Even higher 
\textbf{P} values lead to more noise as the scanner is reacting oversensitive to little 
changes in height. The \textbf{I} parameter defines the contributes proportional 
to the time integral of the error signal. 

In the beginning of the experiment we scanned a calibration grid while varying 
the P and I parameter to estimate the effect on the scan and picture quality.  
The calibration grid consists of a grid with two different height levels. By 
scanning the grid in one direction one should observe steps in the up and down 
direction. First we started with a low I value and observed the $z$-coordinate 
adapting slowly to the actual height of the grid as shown in \ref{wenigI}.

By increasing the I value the height is adapting much quicker but overshoots at 
the step's edge as well as increasing the amount of noise during the plateaus. 
The height profile is plotted in \ref{vielI}.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Height profiles of single lines and the effect of different 
    feedback parameters and scanning velocities. Scanning direction is from left 
    to right.}
\end{figure}

In the next step the influence of the P value was observed. With the I value set 
to $9$ the P value was varied from $5$ to $15$. Interestingly a decrease of the 
P value to $5$ does not change much other than increasing the overshoots caused 
by the I value, which is set little higher than the optimum value. 
Simultaneously the overshoots decrease when increasing the P-value. This however 
has a negative influence on the noise shown in the comparison of \ref{wenigP} 
and \ref{vielP}.

As a trade-off between fast and accurate height adaption and a minimum of noise 
we choose $\mathrm{I}=9$ and $\mathrm{I}=7$. We use these parameters in all 
following measurements, if not stated differently.

To investigate what influence the speed of scanning has on the image recording 
we measure the calibration grid with $\SI{0.7}{\second}$ and $\SI{3}{\second}$ 
per line. During this period 256 data points are recorded along the scanning 
axis.  At slow scanning speed we observe a clear step of the calibration grid 
without any noticeable overshoot in \ref{slow}. At a faster scanning speed 
we can see in \ref{fast} distinct overshoots at the beginning of each step.

Although we observe artifacts while scanning the calibration grid with  
$\SI{0.7}{\second}$ per line it is possible to measure smooth structures 
at higher scanning speeds without observing overshoots.

\subsection{Data preparation}
When acquiring data there is always an interpretation and processing involved.  
This is necessary to make sense of the data, especially when dealing with big 
data sets. This strongly depends on the uses of the data, i.e. getting a general 
idea of an object or measuring something with great accuracy to search for yet 
undiscovered principles. While the unprocessed set has little meaning, we edit 
it and thereby imprint a meaning into the data. Some may argue this leads to 
wrong data, or at least reduces its quality. On the other hand, there is no such 
thing as a perfect measurement.  Therefore the data we acquire will never be an 
exact representation of the object we want to project. We need to make 
corrections based on our model of the world to increase the quality and, even 
more crucial, the usefullness of our measurements.  It is absolutely necessaty 
not to accidentally manipulate the data in a unscientific manner. Thus we need 
to know all the time what has been done with the data and to document the 
process of analysis. \\
With the AFM we scan a sample with great precision in a rasterized format. Each 
image consists of discrete coordinates. Our goal is to analyse the samples 
surface. One step is the removal of systematic errors. If the sample is known to 
be flat we can make a fit to the underground. While manipulating the data quite 
a bit, we remove a simple error, i.e. a tilt in the plane known to be something 
irrelevant for our purpose. In this case even underground fits of higher order 
might be useful considering deviations created by nonlinearities of the piezo 
tube or other elements. On this example we want to show how this is done in 
detail, when it is legitimate and where problems may occur. In \ref{7} the 
raw data image from sample \textcircled{7} are plotted.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}{0.45\columnwidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Bilder/7}
        \caption{The raw data image from sample \textcircled{4}. }
        \label{7}
    \end{subfigure}
    ~
    \begin{subfigure}{0.45\columnwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Bilder/7f}
        \caption{Data of sample \textcircled{4} flattened in row and column. }
        \label{7f}
        \label{vielI}
    \end{subfigure}

    \caption{Height profiles of single lines and the effect of different 
    feedback parameters and scanning velocities. Scanning direction is from left 
    to right.}
\end{figure}

We can clearly identify the horizontal direction in which the tip scanned the 
sample. After each row the tip is afflicted with a different offset leading to 
different heights/colors for each row. This offset is not a feature of our 
sample, so we try to manipulate the data in a way to get rid of this effect.
In detail this is done by fitting a parabola to each row of our sample, 
subtracting this parabola from the raw data afterwards. The same method applied 
on the single column removes the tilt in the $y$-axis. After applying this 
flatten function the features of our sample are much better visible and the 
stripy surface has been manly removed. \\
As mentioned before every correction falsify the data to a certain amount and 
the method should not be applied without being aware of the problems which may 
occur.



In the \ref{7} the surface of \textcircled{1} is showed. Noticeable in the 
middle of the picture we find a peak on a otherwise flat surface. By applying 
the flatten function we receive the picture shown in \ref{7f}. Horizontally and 
vertically from the peak a darker cross has emerged. This can be explained in 
the following way. By fitting over the row/column including the peak the mean 
height is higher. By subtracting the fitted function from raw data, every 
row/column including the peak is lowered more than the other ones. This leads to 
an unwanted artifact near the peak.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.45\columnwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Bilder/1}

    \end{subfigure}

    \caption{Height profiles of single lines and the effect of different 
    feedback parameters and scanning velocities. Scanning direction is from left

\end{figure}

In summary we consider the flatten method a a legitimate tool for data 
preparation but one has to be aware of the artifacts which may occur.


%Implemented in the design of the AFM every scan is 
%usually done twice, once in forward and once backward direction. This reduces  
%random fluctuations and allows for an estimate of the noise.

\subsection{Signal and noise}
\label{san}
During the measurements of the calibration grid the amplitudes of the single 
steps are much higher than the level of noise. While measuring flatter surfaces 
this in not the case however. During the measurement of sample \circled{4} 
we observed features which are in order of $\SI{4}{\nano\meter}$.  Here it 
becomes more and more important to quantify the amount of noise to distinguish 
between real features and random noise.
From the difference between the forward and backward scans we can estimate the 
amount of noise comprised in our data: First we take the data points from one 
line, forward and backward, and shift them to a maximum overlap. Secondly we 
calculate the difference between these two scans. From these aberrations we 
receive a standard deviation between the two scans. Dividing by $\sqrt{2}$  
provides the standard deviation of the measurement.
As an example in \cref{noise} the signal and an area with the size of the 
measurement's standard deviation is plotted. The signal is calculated by the 
mean value of the forward and backward scan.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Bilder/sn_signal2}
        \caption{Height profile plotted with an estimation of noise. Two peaks 
        at $\SI{100}{\micro\meter}$ and $\SI{185}{\micro\meter}$ are visible 
        which are much higher than the level of noise. }
        \label{noise}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Therefore we can say that the peaks at $\SI{100}{\micro\meter}$ and 
$\SI{185}{\micro\meter}$ are real features while there is no significance for 
the peaks beyond $\SI{200}{\micro\meter}$.

Additionally to the noise we observe artifacts which can be clearly identified 
as they only appear in one, either forward or backward direction. One artifact 
we want to discuss is shown in \cref{artifact1}. In one single line we can see a 
periodic pattern which is shown in \ref{artifact1}. The the periodicity of this 
artifact is approximately $\SI{2.5}{\micro\meter}$ but we find oscillations with 
an other periodicity as well. Artifacts on single lines can be caused by small 
particles which are pushed over the sample by the tip. This however doesn't 
explain the regular oscillation.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Bilder/artifact1}
        \caption{Surface of sample \textcircled{4}. One line recorded a periodic 
        oscillation. This artifart is not visible in the backward scan.}
        \label{artifact1}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Furthermore we found pattern which looks like concentric sets of ovals. The 
distance between two ovals decreases as their size increases. We find these 
elliptic pattern in every of our GaSb samples. One surface with clearly visible 
patterns is shown in \ref{artifact2}. As these pattern are visible in the forward 
and backward scanning direction they could be caused by features of the surface.
On the other hand the ovals don't correlate with the crystal structure or the
peaks on the surface which commends to an artifact. If it is an artifact it could
be on the one hand caused by an interference between a plain and a spherical wave. 
But to explain the pattern which are presented in \ref{artifact2}, the wavelength should be in
the order of $\SI{200}{\nano\meter}$ which is to short for laser light.
On the other hand these pattern could be a moiré-pattern caused by the discrete
lateral resolution which equals $\SI{50}{\micro\meter}/265 = \SI{195}{\nano\meter}$.

\section{Sample Analysis}

<<<<<<< HEAD
On the surfaces of our samples we found single accumulations of material 
typically in the order of several angstroms. Interestingly in the vicinity of 
these Peaks the average height seems to be significantly lower than on the rest 
of the surface. It seems like the every peak accumulates material from a radius 
of around $\SI{1}{\micro\meter}$. This effect can be explained by potentials 
which cause atoms to move and adsorb at a step while it hinders atoms to leave a 
plateau. These potentials are calls Schwoebel barriers \cite{merikoski}.

As mentioned in \cref{motivation} one of the goals of this experiment was to 
quantify and analyze the roughness $\rho$ of a variety of surfaces. We concluded 
that an appropriate measure would be the normalized surface area of the 
interpolated polygons between our background corrected points as measured by the 
AFM. In principle it denotes the deviation of a flat surface as:

\begin{align}
    \rho = \frac{S_{\text{polygons}}}{S_{\text{projected}}} - 1
\end{align}

For further reference please see \cref{roughness}.  \\
To estimate the error of this value we calculate the roughness of a randomly generated
surface with a deviation in height which is equal to the noise estimated in \ref{san}.
All the values of surface roughness together with this error are presented in \cref{table:r}

\begin{tabular}{ c | l | l }
  sample & property & roughness $\rho$\\
  \hline                        
  \circled{1} & An untreated GaSb wafer &  $2.55(7) \cdot 10^{-5}$\\
  \circled{2} & $\SI{200}{\nano\meter}$ GaSb buffer at 485\textdegree & $0.61(7) \cdot 10^{-5}$\\
  \circled{3} & $\SI{200}{\nano\meter}$ GaSb buffer at 515\textdegree & $0.54(7) \cdot 10^{-5}$\\
  \circled{4} & $\SI{10}{\nano\meter} $GaSb buffer plus & $0.49(7) \cdot 10^{-5}$\\
  &$\SI{30}{\nano\meter}$ AlAsSb plus \\
  &$\SI{160}{\nano\meter}$ GaSb buffer at 515\textdegree \\
  \hline  
  \label{table:r}  
\end{tabular}

In sample \circled{1} there are actual scratches on the surface. Since it is the 
untreated wafer we suspect this arising from a polishment after the fabrication. 
This sample shows a much larger roughness than the other treated samples. The 
second sample \circled{2} is smooth on most areas, but we find large isolated 
features across the surface. While the sample \circled{3} is the same as the 
previous one but grown at a higher temperature, we do not find those larger 
features on the surface and therefore the surface is even smoother. The smallest 
roughness was measured on sample \circled{4}. On this sample a layer of 
AlAsSb was grown, producing a few wider features only little higher than the 
average. But as the overall surface is smoother, this contribution is not as big 
as to increase the roughness above the other samples. Here the corrected samples 
were described. Except for the untreated sample \circled{1} the background 
correction yields a decrease of the roughness of about a factor of two. Although 
there is a flattening involved in this correction the largest contribution is 
attributed to the fact that the scan lines are fitted separately. Irregularities 
and systematic errors arising from the fact of line switching or directional 
changes are thereby minimized. 

\section{summary}
During the AFM experiment we investigated the surface if different samples.  
Starting with a calibration grid we investigated the influence of different 
scanning parameter like P and I feedback-loop values and different scanning 
speeds. Furthermore we investigated the roughness of four GaSb samples. While an 
untreated GaSb-wafer shows ditches caused by polishing the overgrow of 
$\SI{200}{\nano\meter}$ GaSb buffer leads to significant lower surface 
roughness. Two different growth temperatures were tested.
The buffer grown at $515$\textdegree exhibited a lower surface roughness than 
the one grown at $485$\textdegree. Further we tested a sample with a 
$\SI{30}{\nano\meter}$ AlAsSb layer during the GaSb layer, which was itself 
reduced to $\SI{170}{\nano\meter}$. On the one hand we found even lower average 
surface roughness. On the other hand we found single peaks in range from 
$\SI{4}{\nano\meter}$ to $\SI{6}{\nano\meter}$ which were not removed from the 
surface as it indicated previous publications \cite{murray}.\\
Different kinds of artifacts were discussed and we showed the advantages and 
risks of data preparation.
